## âœ¨ New Features

- **Subclassing support**  
  Fully supports the Arcanist class and subclassing. When you add any Arcanist skill lines the add-on will be visible to that character. Upon removing Arcanist subclassed skill lines (even via the armory) the addon will no longer appear for that character. As long as the addon is enabled in your addons menu, it will automatically detect Arcanist skill line changes with zero player input required.

- **Crux expiration warning system**  
  Customize a threshold in seconds at which the Crux buff is considered "about to expire". When that threshold is reached:
  - The crux runes color updates to the Expiry Warn Rune Color specified in the addon settings
  - The background ring color updates to the Expiry Warn Background Color specified in the addon settings
  - The aura (crux count) color updates to the Expiry Warn Aura Color specified in the addon settings
  - Flash in warn threshold animation effects

- **UI and performance improvements**  
  Includes code refactoring, visual polish, and optimzation of the original Crux Counter addon.
